## How to use Slack

We will use Slack to organize course discussions. [Sign up for our course Slack team here!](https://join.slack.com/t/bst2192023/shared_invite/zt-1wo43n5bm-r3CdPJRt4uaq~uCbOj2zow) You will need to create an account with a username, and log in to read and post. You can use Slack right from a web browser, or you can download a standalone Slack application to your [Mac](https://slack.com/downloads/osx), [Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows), [Linux](https://slack.com/downloads/linux) and/or [Android](https://slack.com/downloads/android)/[iOS](https://slack.com/downloads/ios) device. You can control whether you receive notifications on new posts by going to Preferences, as well as decide which channels to subscribe to. A channel is a discussion thread, which is used to organize communications into topics. You can learn more about Slack features [here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members).

Several channels have been set up for specific parts of the course. The TFs will provide additional resources and discussion regarding the lecture material in these channels. They will also answer any quesions that arise. Feel free to ask questions during class, or anytime. You can browse the available channels in our team by clicking on "Channels" on the left-hand panel.
