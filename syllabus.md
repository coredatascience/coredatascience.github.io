## Course Description

Modern technology has led to the generation of unprecedented amounts of data, prompting the need to train researchers to leverage data for decision-making in public health and medicine. This course assumes no prior knowledge and serves as a gentle, practical introduction to data wrangling, visualizing, and modeling data using the R statistical programming language. We also emphasize the importance of reproducible research and effective data science communication.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, you should be able to:
* Write reproducible code using the statistical programming language R
* Clean and wrangle data for downstream analysis
* Perform exploratory data analysis, including visualizations
* Apply machine learning models for regression and classification

## What is the structure of this course?

This course will be held synchronously and in-person. We encourage students to attend class and participate, but attendance is not required. All lectures and lab sessions will be recorded and available on the course Canvas site.

Grades will be based on:
* 4 homework assignments (40%)
* 1 take-home midterm (25%)
* 1 final project (35%)

## Homeworks [ðŸ”—](/homeworks/)

All [homeworks](/homeworks/) will involve writing code and communicating results. **Students must submit both the RMarkdown file <ins>AND</ins> the knitted HTML file associated with each assignment in their individual repository.** A private repository for each assignment will be created for each student and will only be visible to the student and course teaching staff.

Each student is given two late days per homework assignment. A late day extends the individual homework deadline by 24 hours without penalty. No more than two late days may be used on any one assignment. Late days are intended to provide flexibility; they can be used for any reason, no questions asked. Students don't get any bonus points for not using late days. Late days can only be used for individual homework deadlines; all other deadlines (e.g., project milestones, midterm exam) are firm.

Even if students exceed their late days, we will accept their homework but will deduct 10% (10 points) for each extra late day.

**Due to the unpredictable nature of COVID-19, students in need of extra time to complete assignments should reach out to Student Affairs at StudentAffairs[at]hsph.harvard.edu. A staff member will work with you and Dr. Li to accommodate you. You can also contact Student Affairs if you have a learning disability that requires accommodations. We will ensure you are accommodated as needed.**

The teaching fellows (TFs) must be able to knit submitted RMarkdown files. The penalty for not being able to knit a file while grading increases for each subsequent homework assignment, as outlined below. To avoid this, students should make sure to include relative paths to files, data, images, etc., rather than absolute paths.

* 0 points for HW1
* 5 points for HW2
* 10 points for HW3
* 15 points for HW4

**Students may ask questions about the assignments during lecture, but questions about grading should be directed to the TFs or Dr. Li via email, outside of lecture and lab sessions.**

## Take-home Midterm [ðŸ”—](/midterm)

A take-home [midterm](/midterm) will be distributed in the form of an RMarkdown file in October (date TBD) to test comprehension of course material. The exam will consist of multiple-choice questions, coding questions, and short-answer questions. All code used and text answers must be submitted using the RMarkdown file. Students will have one week to work on the exam and must submit it via Canvas by 11:59 pm on the deadline (TBD). **Students are encouraged to use lecture slides, lab material, homework assignments, and the Internet, but may not collaborate with other students.**

**Due to the unpredictable nature of COVID-19, students in need of extra time to complete assignments should reach out to Student Affairs at StudentAffairs[at]hsph.harvard.edu. A staff member will work with you and Dr. Li to accommodate you. You can also contact Student Affairs if you have a learning disability that requires accommodations. We will ensure you are accommodated as needed.**

## Final Project [ðŸ”—](/project)

Students will work in small groups on a month-long data science [project](/project). The goal of the project is to go through the complete data science process to answer a series of questions using an assigned dataset. You will design visualizations, run statistical analyses, and communicate results. A full description is available on the course website.

## Course Readings

None. Instead, students are encouraged to read the [lecture documents](/lectures) and other [resources](/resources) available on the course Canvas site and the course GitHub repository.
